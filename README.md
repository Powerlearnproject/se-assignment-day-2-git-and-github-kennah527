## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Repository: A repository is a storage location where all the files and their revision history are kept. It serves as the central hub for all project-related data. ​

Commit: A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the files in the repository. Each commit includes a unique identifier, the author's information, a timestamp, and a message describing the changes.​

Branch: A branch allows developers to work on different features or fixes in isolation from the main codebase. This enables parallel development without interfering with the primary project.​

Merge: Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. This is crucial for combining different lines of development and ensuring that all features are incorporated into the main codebase.​

Clone: Cloning creates a copy of the repository on a developer's local machine, allowing them to work offline and synchronize changes later. ​
